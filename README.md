# About us
## What kind of work does Coshx do?
Coshx Labs is a team of collaborators and problem solvers based in Charlottesville, VA who solve our clients' toughest engineering problems. We specialize in full-service software design and development for local and national clients in varied industries such as finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and energy.

## What technologies should I be familiar with?
It short, it doesn't matter to us. We expect all of our designers and developers to learn the skills necessary to deliver great software to our clients. This can mean maintaining existing systems or building software from scratch. We believe that there isn't one correct tool for every job.

## Okay, but what technologies do you secretly like to use?
All of the following technologies have featured heavily in our past projects: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript frameworks and tools (React, Meteor, Angular, Node), Python scripting, iOS development (Swift and Objective-C, React Native), Android (Java, React Native), relational databases (Postgres and MySQL), graph databases (Neo4j), data pipeline tools (Kafka, Spark, Storm, AWS tools and services), and various automation and containerization tools (Ansible, Chef, and Docker).

# Who we are looking for
The right candidate is someone who is excited to learn new technologies, can manage their own time wisely, and wants to contribute in a big way to the team. A previous position as a designer or software developer is not required, but the right candidate should have design or software development experience, ideally having followed through on a project (even a small one) from start to finish. More important than any particular skill is a candidate that takes pride in their work, takes initiative, and is always looking to improve.

Through the application process we hope to learn about both the depth and breadth of a candidate's skills. Ideal candidates have good depth of understanding in one domain (e.g. UI design or JavaScript frontend development) and a broad set of skills that they are less familiar with. 

# Kinds of positions
For both designers and developers, we hire for three types of positions: internships, apprenticeships, and employees. All positions are paid and expect a full-time commitment (~40 hours a week).

## Internships
Internships are temporary without an expectation of a long-term job offer afterwards. Internship candidates are typically full-time students on break (perhaps for the summer).

## Apprenticeships
Apprenticeships are three-month-long positions with the possibility of a long-term job offer afterwards. Apprentice candidates are welcome to apply at any time during the year. An apprentice will build software alongside a team of developers, including other Coshx team members and our clients. Apprenticeships are suitable for candidates without extensive formal design or development experience.

## Employees
Employees are salaried with benefits and typically have some formal design or development experience.
